# Behavior Trees in Godot

Unlike [Unreal](/learn/behavior-trees-in-unreal-engine/), Godot has no built-in behavior
tree system — and unlike [Unity's asset store](/learn/behavior-trees-in-unity/), you won't
be weighing paid options: the leading Godot solutions are free and open source. The real
decision is between two very different philosophies, plus the ever-present option of
writing your own. (Still deciding whether behavior trees fit at all? Start with
[Behavior Trees vs Finite State Machines](/learn/behavior-trees-vs-state-machines/).)

## Option 1: LimboAI (the feature-complete one)

**LimboAI** is the most complete behavior tree implementation for Godot 4: a dedicated
visual tree editor inside the Godot editor, a rich built-in task library, a proper
[blackboard](/learn/behavior-tree-blackboard/) with scoping, live in-editor debugging of
running trees, and custom tasks written in GDScript or C#. It's distributed as a
GDExtension (or compiled-in module), so the core runs as native code rather than
interpreted script.

Two design choices stand out:

- **Trees are resources, not scene nodes.** One `.tres` tree asset can drive any number of
  agents, each with its own blackboard — the same stateless-tree model used by behavior3
  and most production engines.
- **It ships a hierarchical state machine too** (`LimboHSM`), designed to interoperate:
  states can run behavior trees. That's the "FSM at the top, BTs inside" hybrid
  [real games use](/learn/behavior-trees-vs-state-machines/), supported out of the box.

**Choose it if** you're building a serious project and want the closest thing Godot has to
Unreal's integrated BT tooling. **Watch out for**: it's a bigger dependency with its own
editor conventions, and native builds must match your Godot version.

## Option 2: Beehave (the Godot-native one)

**Beehave** takes the opposite approach: behavior trees are built from ordinary Godot
nodes, right in your scene tree. A `BeehaveTree` node has composite children (sequence,
selector — including memory variants), which have condition/action leaves that are just
GDScript classes overriding a `tick()` method.

The appeal is that it feels like Godot — you compose trees in the scene dock you already
know, no new editor to learn, and the whole library is readable GDScript. The trade-offs
follow from the same choice: each agent carries its own copy of the tree as live nodes
(heavier at large agent counts), and there's no equivalent of LimboAI's dedicated editor,
debugger, or blackboard scoping.

**Choose it if** you want the gentlest learning curve, your agent count is modest, and
"just Godot nodes" sounds better than "an embedded AI IDE."

## Option 3: roll your own

A minimal BT core in GDScript is genuinely small — a status enum, a base task with a
`tick()` method, sequence, selector, and a couple of decorators (the
[from-scratch walkthrough](/learn/how-to-implement-a-behavior-tree/) covers the exact
shape, and it ports to GDScript almost line for line). Godot's `Resource` system even
gives you tree serialization for free.

The trap is the same as everywhere: the core is a weekend, the *tooling* — visual
authoring, live inspection — is months. If you go this route, keep design in an external
editor and load a data format rather than hand-building trees in code.

## A design-first workflow for all three

The structure of your tree — priorities, guards, fallbacks — is independent of which
runtime executes it:

1. **Sketch the tree** in the free [online behavior tree editor](/): get the priority
   ladder and conditions right while changes cost nothing.
2. **Walk the design** against the [common patterns](/learn/behavior-tree-examples/) —
   survival override on top? retries around flaky actions?
3. **Translate**: each condition/action leaf in the sketch becomes a LimboAI task, a
   Beehave leaf, or a class in your own runtime; each blackboard key in the design becomes
   a real key.
4. Iterate in the sketch first whenever the logic changes — then mirror it in Godot.
